# Algorithms-Tim-Sort
The Tim sort algorithm combines insertion sort as well as merge sort and for this reasoning, it is considered a hybrid sorting algorithm. The usefulness of this algorithm spans deeply across the coding industry, as this algorithm has been widely used in recent years. Python for example, uses this algorithm for the sorted() method, as well as the list.sort() method. In the process of picking this algorithm, I found it would be necessary to understand an algorithm that has such a practical use case in the real world. Seeing how many different languages alone incorporate this algorithm, I thought it would be fitting to chose and implement it.
## Project Goals
### Understand Tim Sort
This algorithm is strong in the fact that it handles real world data rather well. Understanding this allows the programmer to see the reasoning of picking such an algorithm, all while being enticed to explore the parts that make the algorithm unique. It is a hybrid sorting algorithm, as was already mentioned, and it also as stable algorithm. Using both insertion sort and merge sort, the goal of the algorithm is to try and limit the number swaps and comparisons that are needed. It takes an array and breaks it down into sub arrays, which can also be called runs. The sub arrays are then pieced back together with the upgraded merge sort algorithm.
#### Time Complexities
- Best Case Time Complexity is Ω(n)
- Average Case Time Complexity θ(n*log(n))
- Worst Case Time Complexity is O(n(log n))
